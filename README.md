### Hello and welcome ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex and I am a software developer currently on the lookout for my first step into the tech industry. Currently enrolled in a Full Stack
Software Development diploma with a 3 year Master Data background. I am very passionate about coding and
always want to develop my current skills and learn new skills. I am comfortable with both front-end as well as back-end.
